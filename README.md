Project Overview
This project analyzes call center performance data using Python and Matplotlib. The goal is to evaluate operational efficiency by examining wait times and call volume distribution across branches and call purposes.
The analysis focuses on identifying performance patterns, operational bottlenecks, and opportunities for improvement using data visualization.

Objectives
Compare wait time distributions between branches
Analyze call volume by purpose
Evaluate how wait times vary across different call types
Draw data-driven conclusions about operational performance


Visualizations Created

1 Wait Time Distribution by Branch
A boxplot comparing total wait times between North and South branches.
This visualization highlights differences in median wait times and variability.

2 Call Volume by Purpose
A bar chart showing distribution of calls across:
Product Support
Complaint
Sales Support
This identifies which category drives operational demand.

3 Wait Time Distribution by Call Purpose
A boxplot comparing wait times across different call types to evaluate service efficiency and potential customer impact.

Key Findings:
The North branch demonstrates higher and more variable wait times.
Product Support accounts for the majority of call volume.
Complaint calls experience the longest median wait times.
Operational adjustments may improve service consistency and customer satisfaction.

Conclusion:
This analysis demonstrates how data visualization can uncover operational inefficiencies and support data-driven decision-making. By leveraging Matplotlib, the project transforms raw data into actionable business insights.
